# Choose your favorite Superhero!

For this project, we will be using classes for CSS to define and style our html elements.

# Before you begin:


I used a parallax effect for all of the different sections that showed each different SpiderMan. All of this was created just by using HTMl and CSS. The parallax class can be seen below:


.parallax {

  background-attachment: fixed;
  
  background-position: center;
  
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  
  background-size: cover;
  
  min-height: 1000px;
  
}
