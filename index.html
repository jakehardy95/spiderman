  <h2>The Three SpiderMen</h2>
  <p>
    Over the past decade, Sony has portrayed SpiderMan with three different actors: Tobey Maguire, Andrew
    Garfield, and Tom Holland. Throughout generations, people argue about who they think is the best SpiderMan
    especially when they compare to comics (for those that follow the comic series). The next three sections will go through
    my opinions on who I think is the best SpiderMan, both in comparison to the comics and to just the movies.

    <h2>Tobey Maguire</h2>
    <p>
      Tobey Maguire was the very first SpiderMan to be seen on the movie screen. He played in three movies total, SpiderMan, SpiderMan 2, and SpiderMan 3.
      Most people who grew up when the Tobey Maguire movies came out will without a doubt argue that he is the best SpiderMan out of the 3.
      While Tobey Maguire was arguably the best movie based SpiderMan, I don't think that he was the best SpiderMan. If you read the comics,
      SpiderMan is supposed to be witty, funny, and very immature. The original trilogy seemed too serious at times and it didn't have a lot of
      comedic relief like the comic did.

    <h2>Andrew Garfield</h2>
    <p>
      Andrew Garfield, unlike Tobey and Tom, only had 2 movies during his tenure as SpiderMan. Most people believe that he was a really good balance between
      a serious SpiderMan, like Tobey, and a more comic based comedic relief, more similar to Tom. He had two movies with co-star Emma Stone, where he fought The Lizard,
      Electro, and the Green Goblin. Many fans argued that he should have had another film (me included) since he is the only SpiderMan to have less than 3 films (focused on him.
      I would argue that Andrew Garfield is the second best SpiderMan as far as the movie portrayals go.

    <h2>Tom Holland</h2>
    <p>
      Tom Holland has won the many hearts of people around the world. From his start in Captain America: Civil War to his last movie, SpiderMan: No Way Home, he has proven
      everyone that has seen these movies that he can embody the essence of SpiderMan both emotionally in more mature moments and comedically in moments where comedic relief is needed.
      He has proven to be one of, if not the best, SpiderMan additions on the big screen out of the three. In my opinion, he has taken SpiderMan to a whole other level, especially
      when it comes to his screen time in both Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: End Game. He created himself to be almost a young version of Tony Stark with his keeping of the Spidey Suit
      that Tony made him as well as his prowess as a scientist, just like the others. In my opinion, Tom Holland is without a doubt the best SpiderMan on the movie screen.
